\opening{Dear Recruitment Office,} 
 
%PARAGRAPH ONE: State the reason for the letter, name the position or type of work you are applying for and identify the source from which you learned of the opening (i.e. career development center, newspaper, employment service, personal contact).
My name is Daniel Garcia. I am a computer engineer at Univerity of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and I am applying for the internship position of Back End Engineering. I found this opening on the linkedIN website as the position related my interests and experiences. 

%PARAGRAPH TWO: Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its products, services - above all, stress what you can do for the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate for the position. If you have practical work experience, point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the same information the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your qualifications, training, and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume by providing details which bring your experiences to life. 
I have been interested in back end development engineering since I was a freshman in college and it is my curiosity and determination that has contributed to my experience. I have been a large fan of Fitbit for many years and to work for a company that has contributed to my overall health would be a great opportunity. As a result of working for General Dynamics Mission Systems for the past year, I have worked with security in the form of PKI and developing a means to operate in a certitificate controlled environment. The PKI has been designed within a scrum team to be easily extendable and very secure. Also at General Dynamics and along with my own experience, I have developed in Bash and Powershell for the means of automated tasks and task scheduling. Often times these scripts must be done in a limited resource environment and therefore must be modular and must not consume too many resources. I have had a few years of experience in Java and a considerable amount more in C#. I have also gained exposure to MySQL enviroments and using hibernate to provide object-relational mapping to the traditional database model at General Dynamics. I throughly enjoy working with a team and a challenging work environement where rapid learning must be done for development purposes. I love how Fitbit has helped thousands of people, including myself and my family, lose and maintain their weight as well as provide an API for programmers to have access to their data like never before. 
 
%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example, state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an interview. Alternatively, state that you will call on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking the employer for taking time to consider your credentials. 
I would like the opportunity to interview with you. I will contact you in the next two weeks to see if you require any additional information about my qualifications. I would be glad to provide any additional information as needed. Thank you for considering me for this position.

\closing{Kind Regards,}
