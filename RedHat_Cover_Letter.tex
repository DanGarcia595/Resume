\opening{Dear Recruitment Office,} 
 
%PARAGRAPH ONE: State the reason for the letter, name the position or type of work you are applying for and identify the source from which you learned of the opening (i.e. career development center, newspaper, employment service, personal contact).
My name is Daniel Garcia. I am a computer engineer at Univerity of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and I am applying for the internship position of Security Engineering. I found this opening on the linkedIN website as the position related my interests and experiences. 

%PARAGRAPH TWO: Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its products, services - above all, stress what you can do for the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate for the position. If you have practical work experience, point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the same information the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your qualifications, training, and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume by providing details which bring your experiences to life. 
I have been interested in RHEL and the concept of Open Source since I began college. I have been so lucky to be a part of community behind Open Source. When I was introduced to Linux I started on CentOS and forced myself to try a command line environment instead of the usual GUI. I quickly installed apache using the usual yum commands and was very impressed how simple the process was. The interactions I had with CentOS persuaded me to join the Linux community. It was amazing how a company could let the world view and make modifications to their source code knowing that it would benefit everyone. Today the world runs on RHEL and yet it seems to me that so few people know it. An opportunity to work at RedHat would be an opportunity to give back to the community that gave me so much. Over the summer, I had the opportunity to work at General Dynamics Mission Systems in Taunton MA. There I was able to work with RHEL and automate many aspects of their security and software integration. Thanks to the Linux community, I have been inspired to pursue a carrer with Linux and do my part to give users the freedom they deserve.
 
%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example, state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an interview. Alternatively, state that you will call on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking the employer for taking time to consider your credentials. 
I would like the opportunity to interview with you. I would be glad to provide any additional information as needed. Thank you for considering me for this position.

\closing{Kind Regards,}
